To setup such version simply chose  proper urp or hd  version in package manager and install it.
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or urp pipline at start. 
14.0+ RP support pack works also with upper rp versions aswell
It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.
