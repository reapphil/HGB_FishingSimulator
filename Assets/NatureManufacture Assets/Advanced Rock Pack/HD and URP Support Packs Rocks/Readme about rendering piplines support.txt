Make note that packs work with this versions of render piplines which are suitable for unity 2022.3+
-14.0 URP for 2022.3 and higher
-14.0 High Definition rendering pipline (HD RP) for 2022.3 and higher

To setup such version simply chose proper urp or hd  version in package manager and install it.
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or urp pipline at start. 

It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.
